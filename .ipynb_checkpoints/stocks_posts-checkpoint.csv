for few years in wich the possibility to partecipate was estended to a lot of retail users and guess what happened most retail users up to 80 lost money having no idea what they were doing

in the last few weeks gme has been the opportunity for normal people to take something back from the people controlling the market and when they were finally succeeding guess what

 google and apple and removing negative reviews from bad brokers from their app stores put a calendar reminder in 26 weeks to add your review at that time instead of now



lets make a list of the brokers that restricted the purchasing of specific tickers

the worst thing that happened this week were the restrictions that our brokers put on buying specific tickers this obviously affected the stock market tanked those tickers and significantly reduced our trust in the institutions at hand

now im aware the reasons for this are complicated we know that for many of them they were forced to restrict these tickers by their clearing houses apex being the main one we dont exactly know why or whether that is legal or not however

one thing for certain the communication by the brokers and clearing houses was very very very bad this in turns significantly harmed the publics trust in them as well as the institutions in charge of regulating this

here is my list please comment below and let me know which ones ive missed

 horrible brokers  restricted purchasing of certain tickets and liedgloated about it

 note regarding the clearing houses

the first step is to know why brokers restricted the trading the second step is to investigate what happened with the clearing houses currently the following clearing houses seem to have had the most issues

 apex clearing
 barclays
 ikbr

we dont know if these firms acted maliciously protecting themselves before protecting the free market or because they literally had no choice if the former they need to be punished if the later then laws need to change either way something needs to change this post is merely here to put attention on the problem i dont claim to have the solution

additionally there needs to be open communication about this issue currently they are not saying anything on social media regarding this once they do ill update this post with it

note r thiccdiccpricc tried to explain this in some detail here i cannot attest to the accuracyvalidity of his explanation feel free to discuss that on his post


we might keep this information on the sidebarforever please help me build this list to completion if you are using a broker in the bad list even if you are not invested in the tickers that have been restricted please consider moving to a better broker

why hasnt robinhood still not received any form of punishmentfine when they restricted the buying on 50 different stocks back in january,29442,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n2ihgo/why_hasnt_robinhood_still_not_received_any_form/,"this article contains the list

now that a couple months have passed looking back im honestly shocked rh didnt receive any type of finepunishment for that they limited the upside on 50 stocks while still leaving holders open to the full downside i really hope that doesnt happen again",0.0,0.014610389610389608

is anyone else feeling really depressed from the turn of events recently,27613,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8b4pp/is_anyone_else_feeling_really_depressed_from_the/,"i used to be a proud trader and investor determined to break through the shackles of society to reach financial freedom i started out with almost zero and by capitalizing on the stock market frenzy last year i was able to completely change my life around i used to think that if i worked hard did my due diligence traded smartly i could make great investments and someday reach the pinnacle of my financial dreams something has shifted now i no longer feel the same way and im not sure if i ever will again

i wonder if its naive of me to have thought that the free market was fair im not american so i wasnt aware of the parties involved during the financial crisis in 2008 but it seems that many people are equating whats happening now to back then calling out the blatant market manipulation in favor of the rich at the expense of the poor

they can crash multiple brokerages at the same time disable purchase of specific stocks instantaneously manipulate price action in realtime by changing the supplydemand unleash a short ladder attack on the stock price while the trade volume is being restricted weve always understood that the media was manipulated but it was up to us if we wanted to listen but our direct purchase of stocks and outright price action manipulation suddenly it feels very personal

it just makes me so sad to know that this hobby of mine that ive enjoyed and come to love so much is actually controlled by people at the top who can do whatever they want at any time they want in favor of their own interests i came into the investing world filled with hope and excitement and passion for the art of understanding business and capitalizing on opportunities im sad to think that i may never have this outlook again in light of everything thats been coming out  just looking for words of encouragement right now i love investing and i dont want that joy to be taken from me

what gme has taught me in 36 hours of day trading,26720,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lazcak/what_gme_has_taught_me_in_36_hours_of_day_trading/,"jumped on the gme bandwagon on friday 4  316 my 36 hours of day trading has already taught me that no matter how this plays out i will never yolo on a bubble ever again

the principle seemed straightforward hedge funds got lazygreedy overshorted their positions bet against a company that wasnt actually going under and some astute monkies on reddit caught them and triggered a short squeeze even as someone who knows almost nothing about the stock market the basic premise makes sense but the devils in the details and hype is blinding

first red flag was when i realized udeepfuckingvalue did not bet on the short squeeze he bet on undervalued stock price over a year ago he has also trimmed his position such that no matter what happens in the squeeze he walks away with 8 figures so the people screaming if hes still in im still in and look at those brass balls if he can lose 5mm in a day then i can hold are really living up to the dumb ape meme he didnt lose 5mm yesterday he lost 5mm in unrealized gains there is a huge difference

second red flag was a common sense idea that hedge funds wont go down without a fight and they have literally billions of dollars and decades of experience you dont get that without learning how to game the system in complex subtle ways so even if they are still heavily shorted which they might not even be anymore and even if somehow rwsb is holding some kind of meaningful leverage over them that doesnt rule out the very real possibility they have a dozen ways out of this that people like me have no idea about

but even in the off chance that somehow this turns around and gme does go to the moon that doesnt change the fact that its bad longterm strategy to bet on bubbles and jump on bandwagons they almost certainly fail and if they dont they only serve to inflate egos that will fall even harder on the next gamble im still holding my shares but i dont expect to see my 1200 ever again in the off chance i break even or see a profit here i will count it as dumb luck and use it as seed money to learn how to invest in real long term gains

edit holy shit rip my inbox no way i can read all that

want to clarify a few things not financial advice

my position i knew i was late to the party i wanted to gamble i knew what i was doing and mostly why i did it hindsight showed me it was more based on emotion than i wanted to admit but still im not surprised by the outcome so far and im totally ok with taking the l and calling it a lesson learned i dont blame dfv wsb or anyone for my choices i own them even proudly because i wanted to step out and take a calculated risk vs sit on the sidelines out of fear of loss im holding because i already bought my tickets to this ride want to see this thing play out and im fine with gambling the final 300 on the outside chance things turn around

your positions brothers sisters nonbinary siblings you are not your portfolio whether up or down your value is not based on how big or small an imaginary number is you are a human being on the bleeding edge of 35 billion years of evolution you have more actual success in your past and potential success in your future than youll ever know 12 years ago i was a penniless alcoholic literally stealing change from my grandpa to get loaded on 211 steel reserve i hit my bottom joined aa and now im a network engineer wife kids the whole lot anything is possible if you dont give up on yourself but i know its not that easy we all need borrowed selfesteem before we can see the real value inside so if this gme gamble hit you hard please reach out to someone dont give up hell this bubble isnt even over it might even turn around but either way dont give up

wow never expected this to go this far wrote it on my way out the door as a way to cope with the situation read a ton of replies probably missed most of them thanks for all the love and hate and everything inbetween a few more points

 agreed that rh deserves to be held accountable no question they manipulated this
 agreed its not over yet the squeeze could happen but if it does my main personal takeaway from this experience will stand i wont speculate on bubbles anymore this is my position if i lose everything or make 100k
 if you posted gains thats awesome so glad for you i wish you the best

pelosi rejects stocktrading ban for members of congress we are free market economy they should be able to participate in that,25550,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rh65q3/pelosi_rejects_stocktrading_ban_for_members_of/,"house speaker nancy pelosi on wednesday rejected the idea of banning members of congress and their spouses from holding and trading individual stocks while in office

this is a free market and people  we are a free market economy they should be able to participate in that pelosi said when asked by insider at her weekly press conference

insider also asked pelosi about conflicted congress a 5monthlong investigation by insider that found 49 members of congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the stock act a law to prevent insider trading

the speaker said she had not yet seen the project but said that its important that members are complying with the law

if people arent reporting they should be she said

pelosis position puts her at odds with the likes of progressives like sen elizabeth warren and rep alexandria ocasiocortez both of whom have called for banning members of congress from trading stocks while in office

it is absolutely ludicrous that members of congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office ocasiocortez recently wrote on twitter the access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest not our profit it shouldnt be legal for us to trade individual stock with the info we have

and on tuesday sen warren told insider that she had seen insiders investigation calling out the brazenness of members and staffers trading stocks even while having access to privileged knowledge

we need both tougher laws and enforcement of those laws the massachusetts democrat told insider the american people should never have to guess whether or not an elected official is advancing an issue or voting on a bill based on whats good for the country or whats good for their own personal financial interests 

asked about progressives position on the issue a spokesman for pelosi signaled that the speaker prefers a transparencyfocused approach to insider trading

the stock act exists to shine a bright light on trades by members of congress said spokesman drew hammill sunlight is the best disinfectant

the speaker does not own any stocks he continued as you can see from the required disclosures with which the speaker fully cooperates these transactions are marked sp for spouse the speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions

pelosis husband investor paul pelosi frequently trades significant numbers of stocks with her husbands assets considered pelosi ranks among the wealthiest members of congress according to an insider analysis

insider has identified numerous examples of federal lawmakers trading stocks in industries they oversee as part of their congressional committee assignments including within the defense healthcare and energy industries

gme short squeeze what comes next part 2,21908,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/,"edit added a warning because people in the comments seem to think im trying to manipulate people

warning this is an extremely risky play there are no metrics or current data to provide solid dd to have a more certain outcome what you are truly betting on is other people i wont try to convince you what to do with your money this is my speculation my opinion  and it very well could be wrong

hello all 

i wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful i am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world

disclaimer i am not a financial advisor but more importantly this is all simply speculation if anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers if anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happenthey are lying there simply isnt enough current data to push this either direction i am a bull big time and i would like to explain why

first lets talk about yesterday

there are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counterclaim is that it was mms moving the price down one thing appears certain there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down whether this is mms hfs or simply retail shorts and bears there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price you can check out the real time quotes here

another large thought about why the price should have gone up yesterday was because of the options thats expired friday 129 itm the rule is t2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover well we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came everyone was glued to the screen friday ath waiting to see the spike of coveringbut it never happened monday againnever happened tuesdayoh boy this is their last day they have to cover yetthey didnt so what does this mean well i see two possibilities

1 they somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes
2 they havent covered yet

im in the camp of number 2 hence why i am a bull if they didnt cover that results in a failure to deliver which you can learn about here so what does this mean for us well that would explain the tremendous price drop as ftds create phantom shares a problem gme is already facing this will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of ftds that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price with forward contracts a party with a short positions failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the long position this difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long positions business operations from the earlier mentioned website regarding ftds

now this is truly fascinating the 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of ftds in fact ftds sometime intentionally happenjust to drive the price down for fud so they can then cover at a better price 

so if this is correct what happens next well either you can read about it here simply put the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of ftd so all this logic about t2 was actually just the logic to begin the ftd countdown if it hasnt already started at the beginning of this

now im not saying nobody sold of course people did but volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 31 monday and tuesday of course trades are 11 but interest was on the buyer side 

obviously i dont even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with my opinion it wasnt to prevent a massive short squeeze it was to buy them time

today

so why the hell did it spike this morning two reasons

1 rh still has 100 shares limit on gme now for those who dont realize that doesnt mean that is 100 shares per day no no the restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of gme if you already own over 100 shares thats fine but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount this restriction has not changed and other companies such as revolut are still imposing a 100 trading restriction on gme so what did rh offer today the ability to purchase fractional shares which doesnt help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there
2 gamestop adds new cto to the roster an ex aws lead engineer they added other executive positions as well this further cements the change the company is taking

now before i get into the rest i want to address something the fundamentals

there is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that gamestop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival that is simply not the case i dont want to do a full gme dd here because this is about the second incoming squeeze however let me put it to you this way

if you were told that a new company was ipoing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure new talented team 50 million customers and their plan was to become an ecommerce company to compete with amazon their plans for the physical locations was to be gamecentric a place for esports to compete desktop building kiosks and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy not just that but this company already has revenue share deals with microsoft and other bigwig companies

knowing all that information would you be interested in this company my answer is an easy yes the thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they cant see what the company is planning on becoming if this was a brand new company that ryan cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept 

enough of that lets talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating 

so the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source but then what well after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quicklybut then something interesting started happening it started uptrending slowly steadily uptrending lower lows higher highs no sight more beautiful 

my interpretation we found the bottom of the bears attack the news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags it will surely send the price up the logic there is simple if people are buying stock it goes up if people are selling it goes down 

so today is pure magic it doesnt need to be a wild swing up to be promising what it needs to be is slow consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading 

but all the shorts covered simply not true that is a fact all we know is what people are telling us melvin says they covered it will be the third time they have claimed that do i think they covered yes i do does that matter no now even if melvin and others covered and the s3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57 short based on their twitter this isnt including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3400 they thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck they saw it get down to 85 and started celebratingbut it starting climbinguh oh

truth is no one will know the real numbers until the 9th i think its a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few daysits possible 

so lets talk about who is currently holding gamestop well a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly dont give a shit they are here out of principle truth be told so am i i absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week so we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze no one is going to sell at these levels some people here and there but it simply isnt worth it not with so much potential for a second squeeze

so when will this second squeeze happen

if the newest shorts are smart it already begun if i took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through you better believe i would be covering now while i have profits not all of them are going to do this which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential there is no telling when it will happen it could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops the 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come if that has anywhere above 50 short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it it could happen as early as this week it could be post earnings when papa cohen tells us his majestic plans during er it could be that er will actually be fantastic on 0305 because it will have the console cycle numbers look at gme charts in the past the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst

in summary

i wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but i knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so i wanted to get something out there in my opinion a second surge a second squeeze is bound to happen this is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and i think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment

x200b

tldr i have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over even if melvin covered and even if s3 numbers are correct at a 57 short these are indicators of another squeeze potentially even more epic the bleeding days of red on monday and tuesday i personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ath didnt blow up due to the itm calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent ftds diluting the share price i do think these ftds were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down if you are a bagholder i think it wise to hold if you have already closed your position i would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity

final disclaimer i have already made a significant sum of money on this gme play this post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status the money i put back in was money i was willing to lose and i came back in out of principle to stick it to the man good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever retail investors have more power than we think",0.0,0.10878348323736667

gme end financial culture how this meme is becoming a serious thing,21135,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l98jee/gme_end_financial_culture_how_this_meme_is/,"it is the first time that the financial market is being used against the same monsters who bet on the failures of companies and enjoy manipulating the markets and impoverishing investors

at least it is the first time it is happening in front of my eyes and i can actively be part of it

what is happening has become very serious but it is experienced with that romanticism and irony that is not often seen in the world of the stock market

the thing that no one mentions however is the incredible contribution that the gme affair is making to global financial culture not only are the videos of youtubers explaining whats going on increasing exponentially but the incredible thing is that even influencers and youtubers completely outside the stock and financial game are talking about it

the consequence of this is that a lot of people are getting informed they are trying to understand what is happening why it is happening and what are the rules and mechanisms that are permitting this situation

this wave of information is spreading at lightning speed financial concepts that have always remained obscure to most people

in short ordinary people are opening their eyes financial education albeit minimal is beginning to be part of the cultural baggage of young and old alike and this will have huge consequences in the future

this meme and the whole gme situation is opening the eyes to the world i could compare it to the boost that the first trips to the moon gave to space engineering or the boost to karate gyms after the success of the movie karate kid or the boost to medical culture that the pandemic thats hitting us is giving

this gentlemen ladies and gentlemen is the major event that is revolutionizing economic culture from the ground up and each one of you is a part of it and each one of you will be able one day to proudly say fk money that time we were the protagonists

be honest who else would have had such an opportunity to use money as a tool against the powerful market manipulators without gme

this is why what is happening is not a meme anymore the world will be different afterwards

tldr

the gme affair is changing the worlds financial culture forever no more financial ignorance no more under the mattress investments no more underhanded economic power plays

president joe biden on wednesday called on us oil refining companies to produce more saying they need to help alleviate the burden of high prices on consumers at a time of war  historically high refinery profit margins being passed directly onto american families are not acceptable the president said in a letter to oil companies including exxon mobil and chevron companies must take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline diesel and other refined product the letter added bidens call comes as skyhigh energy costs add to inflationary concerns across the economy the national average for a gallon of gas crossed 5 over the weekend for the first time on record according to aaa 

the national average now stands at 5014 which is 54 cents more than a month ago and 194 more than last year refiners cant just ramp up output with utilization rates already above 90 additionally some refiners are now being reconfigured to make alternate products like biofuel refining capacity has dropped since the pandemic took hold which is a factor in the rapid advance of fuel prices demand has returned as economies restart and people travel once again but supply remains tight

still there is no easy solution john kilduff partner at again capital said refiners are working at historically high level there is nothing left to ramp up he said kilduff noted that no new refineries have been built in decades but existing units have been expanded prior to the pandemic there had been excess refining capacity which pressured profits years of sanctions on venezuela and iran and now russia has more than contributed to the current situation he said the industry says the administrations policies are to blame for the surge in prices while we appreciate the opportunity to open increased dialogue with the white house the administrations misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas have compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions mike sommers president and ceo of the american petroleum institute said wednesday",0.075,0.07291357452071738

retail investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing anyone investing over 1 billion dollars ie hedge funds and other investment institutions is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets  its called form 13f but did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year and did you know its published with a 1 month delay and did you know that they dont need to disclose all of their positions


we the people are asking for a reevaluation of transparency requirements for institutional investors we have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication  and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors and are concerned that this access is being used against us in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of securities laws we believe that with better access to institutional trading data retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions


according to form 13f  institutional investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year why


filing of form 13f a manager must file a form 13f report with the commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year as required by section 13f5 of the exchange act a manager which is a bank the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the federal deposit insurance act must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every form 13f report filed with the commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank filers who file form 13f electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending a a paper copy of the edgar filing provided the manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes b the filing in electronic format if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format


in your faq  it is clear institutional investors are not required to disclose short positions why


question 41
q what about short positions
a you should not include short positions on form 13f you also should not subtract your short positions in a security from your long positions in that same security report only the long position

gme institutions hold 177 of float,15527,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/,"disclaimer this post is not financial advice  
  
this is actual dd of just statistical cold hard facts my previous post got removed by the compromised mods of rwallstreetbets
  
  
i have access to bloomberg terminal with up to date data as of february 5 on institutional holdings institutions currently hold 177 of the float  
  
  
how is this even possible to own more than 100 of the float heres an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages lets assume company xyz has 20 million shares outstanding and institution a owns all 20 million in a shorting transaction institution b borrows five million of these shares from institution a then sells them to institution c if both a and c claim ownership of the shares shorted by b the institutional ownership of company xyz could be reported as 25 million shares 20  5or 125 25  20 in this case institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100  
  
  
in cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100 actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high while somewhat imprecise arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a companys stock overall  
   
  
i have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling 1 million shares of gme were borrowed this friday at 10 am and a short attack occured that dropped gme from 95 to 70 over the course of 15 minutes  
  
  
this is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours  

so we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible there are a lot of short positions taken in gme still the ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply or are we going to let the wolf in sheeps clothing aka citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves data from 93020  but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buyingare we really going to just let this happen what they did last thursday was straight up criminal   
  
  
institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately especially when order flows go directly through citadel but it is very interesting the amount of otm calls weeks out compared to puts this is options expiring 31221 and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in otm calls max pain theory states it is in the market makers best interest those who write options aka theta gang for price to gravitate towards max pain as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration  
  
  
with this heavy volume abundant in otm calls a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week i believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses and right now we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike if there is a catalystcompany event that can cause demand to increase i believe gme is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above thank you for taking your time to read my dd my original post on wsb was removed by the mods",0.0,0.09744574314574314

a few weeks later it increased 20 on some good news and then dropped 5 for net 15  hes texting me days later wtf poisonivey this stock blows when is it going to take off

with all the recent hype some people are looking for x00 overnight and expect massive gains with no effort  its also really hard to sell when something you own is on a crazy run and fomo creeps in

the key success here is dont get greedy   take your profits and protect your capital core  every stock is different and nothing is ever a sure bet  lululemon used to be a really strong buy but took a huge dip a few years back because of allegations against the founder

my average annual return is 20  its not as sexy as making infinite gains on shorts but it means i will retire a lot sooner than i thought i ever could  if one of my tickers hits bigger than i thought i reassess value and often i take my book value and use the gravy to ride that train the rest of the way

if you could afford to invest 1k per year you could retire w over a million and way more if you can increase your annual investment more each year

compound interest at a rate of return of 20 after
20 years  275k 20k invested  1k per year
25 years  775k 25k invested 1k per year
30 years  13m 30k invested 1k per year

after 30 years you could retire and earn an annual income of 78k with a passive 6 interest without eroding that core 13m

start small and be patient  decide what percentage of your capital you are willing to go yolo on and what amount you need to protect to avoid that holy crap what have i done ive lost everything and im going to vomit feeling

edit  ive been investing 7 years  so as many have commented that isnt long enough to have seen a huge dip and i agree  i dont want to mislead

the point of this post was not to say 20 forever is easy or hard or that everyone should expect that  the point is to protect your capital and take small risks to learn and build

figure out how much pretax  you need to live every year and divide that by 5  thats what you need to retire

the change met fierce resistance from companies like facebook whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users data to target the most effective ads at those users facebook went so far as to take out fullpage newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world shortly after apple ceo tim cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized facebooks business model

nonetheless facebook and others have complied with apples new rule to avoid being rejected from the iphones app store though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the applemandated prompt to opt in or out appears

aron and amc both plan to donate 50000 to the dian fossey gorilla fund  a clear nod to these new investors who call themselves apes and refer to aron as silverback amc also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media including youtube aron has even taken a renewed interest in twitter following hundreds of accounts tied to the ape army

amc investor connect is the next step in the companys strategy of connecting with these investors the platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings as well as direct communications with aron

during my fiveplus year tenure as ceo at amc ive taken great pride in the relationships i have forged with amcs owners aron said in a statement wednesday with amc investor connect that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions after all these people are the owners of amc and i work for them",0.4,0.2297258297258297

tesla sells 1 of cars globally yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99,11489,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qmjr7o/tesla_sells_1_of_cars_globally_yet_is_priced_more/,"the valuation on tesla is now beyond the absurd  

whilst european ev sales explode to presently 19 of all car sales this year tesla does not even make the top five ev sellers by company at a lowly 7 vw 25 stellantis 13 daimler 10 bmw 10 hyundiakia 9

tesla unlike in the us is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative bev models on sale particularly  vw group alone offers the eup id3 and id4 id5 not yet on sale audi etron etron sportback etron gt and rs etron gt cupra born and skoda enyaq

in china tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by byd which has seen ev sales grow from 53k q1 98kq2 183k q3  tesla meanwhile has seen china quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69k 62k and 75k  china will likely sell 3 million evs this year half the worlds volume and tesla sales are flat for the year  tesla might sell a lowly 9

tesla dominates the us markets of course where few ev models are on sale  ev sales might be 3 of automotive sales

whilst investors will assert these stats do notmatter and teslas valuation is all about  tech batteries and robotaxis it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars  take up of fsd is a lowly 11  it still buys its battery cells  by its own statements it has a level 23 driver assist whilst companies like waymo are already starting to offer level 45 robotaxis in cities like san fran a free trial program has commenced

with tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature ev markets globally its ev mkt share has fallen from near 18 highs in 2019 to 147 ytd in 2021  with europe and china likely to see 20 ev sales the tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99 of cars and are adding evs faster

tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global ev market growth

gme  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and i am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble market correction yes some stocks are overvalued but we are in  totally uncharted waters given so much money printing covid but also  investor beliefs in certain markets

you  are buying stocks like aapl and msft at high valuations you are not  that person that bought apple in 2003 and has 120000 gains please be  weary about the other side of your trades  there are people taking huge  profits  if we will have a lot of them in a span of 101530120 days  we might see a market correction

week on week increase in mentions 73

month on month increase in mentions 247

average sentiment across mentions 346

dd

core product

corsair is the leading manufacturer of highperformance gear and technology for games and pc enthusiasts another important part of their portfolio is the brand elgato which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators competitive gamers and streamers currently their products are in high demand and command a significant price premium against other brands

financials

corsair currently has a net revenue of 17b 55 increase yoy and a gross profit of 456mm 107 increase yoy they had 84 increase in the sales of gamer and creator peripherals net income is 103mm compared to 84mm loss last year

they had a gross margin improvement of 69 lesser availability of parts allowed them to jack up their margins and paid off 190mm debt in 2020 current debt of 321mm with 133mm cash in hand

potential and hype factor

people are increasingly spending more and more time on video games and corsair caters to the premium segment in this market adding to this the current explosion in twitch viewership and corsairs marketing strategy of sponsoring famous streamers to showcase their premium gear further adds to the product demand

the company is also benefitting greatly from the changing landscape due to the ongoing covid crisis as more and more people stay home and abstain from their regular hobbies they have turned to digital entertainment with pc gaming being one of the leading contenders  in fact video game consumption is currently at an alltime high and is set to explode even further

risk and competition

i see 3 major risk factors for corsair

a supply constraints they currently have unmet demand due to supply constraints which benefitted their margins but a more severe supply constraint can negatively affect their revenue and brand image

b return to normal the current growth rate might not be sustainable once the pandemic is over and people can return to their regular lifestyle

c one firm owns 80 of the outstanding shares corsair is majorly controlled by eagletree capital which has majority voting power and an 80 ownership of the company

conclusion

corsair currently has about 20 market share for gaming peripherals and 40 market share for pc components putting them in an ideal situation to capture any future growth although there is some risk in terms of supply constraints and return to normal their brand product line and current financials are put them in a very strong position

responding to a growing controversy over investing practices the federal reserve on thursday announced a ban on officials owning individual stocks and limits on other activities as well the ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the federal open market committee along with senior staff future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies nor can they invest in individual bonds hold agency securities or derivative contracts the new rules replace existing regulations that while somewhat restrictive still allowed members to buy and sell stocks these tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a singleminded focus on the public mission of the federal reserve fed chair jerome powell said in a statement under the new rules the officials will have to provide 45 days notice in advance of buying or selling any securities that are still allowed they also will be required to hold the securities for at least a year and cannot buy or sell funds during heightened financial market stress a news release announcing the moves said

the rules come on the heels of disclosures that multiple fed officials had been buying and selling stocks at a time when the central banks policies were designed to improve market functioning particularly during the covid crisis regional presidents robert kaplan of dallas and eric rosengren of boston both resigned shortly after disclosures that they had engaged in trading of individual securities last year in kaplans case the moves occurred in largedollar allotments vice chairman richard clarida also had been featured in the reports powell also sold securities last year though they were exchangetraded funds that tracked market indexes",0.0,0.023541414141414137

if you look at the 60 call options 23k were purchased and assuming that the delta on that was 5 thats another 115 million shares that were purchased to hedge 

another 1718k options were purchased between 5159 which means around another million shares were purchased during the run up

kellogg to permanently replace striking employees as workers reject new contract,9906,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rbhzkp/kellogg_to_permanently_replace_striking_employees/,"kellogg said on tuesday a majority of its us cereal plant workers have voted against a new fiveyear contract forcing it to hire permanent replacements as employees extend a strike that started more than two months ago

temporary replacements have already been working at the companys cereal plants in michigan nebraska pennsylvania and tennessee where 1400 union members went on strike on oct 5 as their contracts expired and talks over payment and benefits stalled

interest in the permanent replacement roles has been strong at all four plants as expected we expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon kellogg spokesperson kris bahner said

kellogg also said there was no further bargaining scheduled and it had no plans to meet with the union

the company said unrealistic expectations created by the union meant none of its six offers including the latest one that was put to vote which proposed wage increases and allowed all transitional employees with four or more years of service to move to legacy positions came to fruition

they have made a clear path  but while it is clear  it is too long and not fair to many union member jeffrey jens said

union members have said the proposed twotier system in which transitional employees get lesser pay and benefits compared to longertenured workers would take power away from the union by removing the cap on the number of lowertier employees

several politicians including bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have backed the union while many customers have said they are boycotting kelloggs products

kellogg is among several us firms including deere that have faced worker strikes in recent months as the labor market tightens

disclaimer i am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst

another disclaimer if you do not know what exactly a stock is how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are please look up some crash courses on youtube or something before starting this list

lets begin

1 the little book of common sense investing by john bogle  for those of you who dont know john bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person he founded a little company called vanguard ever heard of it and he also invented the first index fund in this book bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive conservative and longhaul investing he goes into the statistics on how around 90 of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market he makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth many people probably most people to be honest can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine the info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth you will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a losers game one of the reasons i believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading if you arent content with boring old index fund investing though you can read on
2 one up on wall street by peter lynch  this book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day peter lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time he achieved returns that beat the sp 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the fidelity magellan fund in the 70s and 80s yes i know i said most people cant beat the market by picking stocks which is why those who can do it consistently are very special in this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results its a great book because it doesnt get too crazy in terms of math and logic and its easy to understand
3 thinking fast and slow by daniel kahneman  now its time to take a break and get into the psychology behind stock investing lets be honest were all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases these two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success the sooner you admit that the better off youll be this book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making

x200b



ok now at this point you have two paths you can take after these three books youll have a good grasp on the theory and mindset to making money in stocks but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually pick individual stocks i mean how are you supposed to do that just buy whatever is trending on reddit or what that idiot jim cramer on cnbc is talking about well as long as you still understand from book 1 that the odds are against you when picking stocks you can continue on one of two paths

 the value investing path finding analyzing and buying stocks that are undervalued and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value thus making a ton of money this is what warren buffett does its also extremely difficult boring and requires rocksolid emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market

or

 the traders path following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money i personally would not consider this path to be an investors path this is a speculators path and they are very different however you can make money speculating this could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options this path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose hours of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions

if you chose the value investing path continue here

1 all of the accounting books you can find  you need to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses there is no getting around it yes its boring but if you find yourself enjoying it you may have an inclination for this read everything you can on accounting learn to read balance sheets income statements and cash flow statements learn about assets and liabilities do the practice assignments in the books and all of that
2 the intelligent investor by benjamin graham  this is probably the most famous book on this list and guess what youre not going to understand any of it this is the book that warren buffett swears by in fact buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad this book is the bible of value investing every successful investor knows this book within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market how to understand market behavior what a good business looks like how to find the intrinsic value of a company and much much more i recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you dont understand
3 margin of safety by seth klarman  physical copies of this book are extremely expensive so youre better off finding an online copy shh dont tell its a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor
4 the dhando investor by mohnish pabrai  fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books also written by a very successful investor

if you chose the traders path continue here

1 reminiscences of a stock operator by edwin lefvre  a classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives it teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your winslosses psychology of trading knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff its an old book but definitely worth reading
2 getting started in technical analysis by jack schwager   if you dont know technical analysis ta is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price volume and trends it ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you dont i personally am not a fan however i do recognize the importance ta plays in understanding some stocks at certain times i do believe that in combination with other metrics ta can provide valuable insight this book will teach you the basics
3 fooled by randomness by nassim nicholas taleb  it is not possible to predict the stock market this book will help you reconcile with that it will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading but your whole life you will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them
4 market wizards by jack schwager  another great book by the same author as 2 above this is written in a sort of conversationlike format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time there is tons of information in this book on all of the topics weve discussed since its like youre reading a conversation between two people

advice literally the only times i have made large strides in my wealth are during a dipcrashrecession i cant be the only one excited,9511,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m043o7/advice_literally_the_only_times_i_have_made_large/,"a lot of people including my parents and me suffered after 2008 we often hear ppl losing everything and getting set far back in lives what we dont often hear are people who loaded up in 2008 regular average people those with small savings be it stocks or the housing market which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after those folks got literally everything on a massive discount

think about it from that angle if i have some money saved up now and it were 2008 again i would be fkin ecstatic because after 45 years i would gain 1000 easily and thats not even going into real estate

also recent example of last march will confirm my point i made huge gains from it i only bought costco etsy and homedepot no technical analysis no charts no graphs nothing they were on sale and i assume people will be using them during the pandemic average intelligent move there was no depth to it

and even if you dont maximize your portfolio literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run you can be dense and still make money

so chill tf out the dip is an opportunity its a fking gift

were all familiar with buy the dip well heres the same principles with a minor tweak buy the big dip

reminder  whether you own gme or not  change your goddamn broker,9108,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/,"hello everyone

last weekend i created a thread in which i documented which brokers stopped people from purchasing specific securities and which ones didnt

before it gets forgotten i want to bring that list back again and insist that you get a new broker if yours is one of the bad ones

this is a much much bigger issue than you think and this can and will affect you eventually if you stay with a broker that decides that you cannot trade a security that they dont want you to trade note that the securities affected were not just meme stocks several large stocks some of you might own or have heard about were restricted and their price was thus manipulated including

 general motors
 rolls royce
 trivago
 workhorse group
 jaguar health

and many more

when boomer stocks get affected this means the entire free market is at risk and the next time this happens you might be the one unable to trade your favorite stock if you continue using a bad discount broker 

whether this is the brokers fault or their clearinghouses fault is irrelevant the result is your inability to engage in the free market this behavior needs to be punished to ensure other brokers dont start doing the same thing

here is my list of brokers which i will continue to update as per the previous thread

i analyzed 9000 trades made by members of the us congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against sp500 here are the results,8218,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nanrlu/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_members_of_the_us/,"preamble the ability of congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start the 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain  while there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legalityethical aspects of this what i wanted to know is

did congress members beat the market and can i beat the market if i follow their trades after its been made public

where is the data from senatestockwatchercom

massive shoutout to urambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public the website has data of congress trading from 2019 while i could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site given that we have more than 9k trades to work with i feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective also please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate either they were in senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades

while congress members are supposed to report the transaction within 30 days the median delay in reporting that i observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days there were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately

all the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end

analysis

a total of 9676 trades were made by the members in the past two years this analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators the stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself out of the 4911 buys what i am really interested in is the 1375 transactions which were over 15k i decided on this cutoff as i did not want small transactions 5k to affect the analysis the hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10 of their annual salary into one trade they should be very confident about the stock i know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily

results for all the stock purchases i calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against sp500 returns during the same period 

a            one month

b            one quarter

c             till date from the date of purchase to today

returns made by the congress

avg return change in price change in spychange over spy

one month255242012
one quarter876742134
till date32402640599

at this point it should not come as a surprise but congress did beat sp500 across the different time periods but what i am really interested in is if its possible to follow their trades after disclosure after a time lag of 30 days and still beat the benchmark

returns if you followed their trades after the disclosure

avg return change in price change in spychange over spy

one month20248048
one quarter1046789257
till date29622373589

if you had invested in the stocks congress bought even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure you would beat sp500 over the long run my theory for this is that congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden shortterm gains can put a spotlight on their trades this gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit

limitations of analysis there are multiple limitations to the analysis

1 the time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run so the results might change in a market downturnrecession
2 the data has been sourced from senatestockwatchercom as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult all the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them you can find it in the google sheet i have made my best effort to qc the data and make sure there are no false positives but this might not contain all the transactions made by congress
3 there is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by congress the disclosure is always in ranges eg 100k  200k so for calculating the investment amount i have taken the average of the given range

conclusion

this analysis proves that congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stockpicking capability is something that cant be proven from the data and is left to the readers judgment i intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as i felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis

whichever side of the political spectrum you leanto the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades

the wealthiest 10 of americans own a record 89 of all us stocks,8101,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qamr6g/the_wealthiest_10_of_americans_own_a_record_89_of/,"

the wealthiest 10 of americans now own 89 of all us stocks a record high that highlights the stock markets role in increasing wealth inequality the top 1 gained over 65 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the covid19 pandemic while the bottom 90 added 12 trillion according to the latest data from the federal reserve the share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10 reached the record high in the second quarter while the bottom 90 of americans held about 11 of stocks down from 12 before the pandemic the stock market which has nearly doubled since the march 2020 drop and is up nearly 40 since january 2020 was the main source of wealth creation in america during the pandemic  as well as the main driver of inequality the total wealth of the top 1 now tops 32 a record according to the fed data nearly 70 of their wealth gains over the past year and a half  one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history  came from stocks


the top 1 own a lot of stock the rest of us own a little said steven rosenthal senior fellow urbanbrookings tax policy center the growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic leading to what many have labeled the democratization of stocks robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million  many of them held by younger firsttime investors yet while the market may be owned more broadly the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous they are also still small with the average account size at robinhood at about 4500 when markets rise they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings


many of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains rosenthal said whats more many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality  buying and selling stocks rapidly with leverage in hopes of quick gains while the strategy can create big winners others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term the top 10 saw the value of their stocks gain 43 between january 2020 and june of 2021 according to the fed the bottom 90 saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate  33 they might account for a larger share of trading activity but thats different from ownership and wealth rosenthal said",0.6,0.17724831649831652

i made 500000 trading stocks and options in 18 months these are the 15 things i did that worked best,7902,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qi92fg/i_made_500000_trading_stocks_and_options_in_18/,"i failed a lot while trading before during and after succeeding i havent counted it up but its likely i encountered losses in excess of 150000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided rash decisions and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies net net im up 500000 but i was asked to share some of what worked for me over im quite a bit after my last post and figured id lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way as i did 

these are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation  someone trying to increase net worth not increase income  and they may not be suitable for everyone

understand the trading environment

one mistake i made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment i was in before picking out a strategy what do i mean i need to know where things are in the year in relation to earnings season and in relation to sector rotations i need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and i need to watch the vix

mind the gap between earnings seasons i cant stress this enough when earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in investors watch those like hawks good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market 

in between earnings seasons there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation 10year bond yields and what the fed is doing this makes for a much jumpier market thats more likely to pull back  its also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios they manage billions so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class eg value stocks energy and underweight in other asset classes eg growth stocks technology

i try not to get caught by these patterns i anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly simply put i buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule of course i dont do this if i expect a terrible earnings season 

take advantage of sector rotations

the sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year i do this by plotting sector etfs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside if i run the pe ratios for the sector etfs i can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 pe vs other sectors that are more modestly valued just keep in mind that certain sectors like tech will always be valued more richly given their growth so looking at pe ratios is not apples to apples  its just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range

last years worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year this is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high i dont bet against this trend its been around longer than i have and will continue to be around long after im dirt 

last year you couldnt give away a barrel of oil last week oil reached 80 a barrel 

one of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector etfs that underperformed the previous year i buy calls with expirations in 69 months knowing that i will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100 gain sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year other times it takes 9 months so long as i dont overpay for the options it works i dont like to pay more than the average price return of the sector for example if the sector etf averages a 10 annual return and the etf price is 100 im not going to buy a call for more than 10 that way if the sector only moves 5 i can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough

make the vix your friend

the vix is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks if the vix goes up the market is worried if it goes down the market is getting bullish if it stays up everyone is on edge its hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button so be careful buying during times when the vix is high on the flip side if the market has pulled back and the vix starts to retreat away from its highs that makes for a good entry point 

another interesting phenomenon is when the vix is higher than normal there tends to be a selloff the friday before a long weekend this happens because investors dont want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their tuesday with losses piling up ive found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day friday or to run some weekly puts on thursday afternoon before the dips 

selecting trades  investments

have an allocation plan

the first thing i recommend is determining in advance the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies anything shorter term is higher risk higher reward i break my portfolio in the following buckets

 25 longterm market investment using equity etfs that largely track the spx or do a breakdown between bonds and the market i use vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called calf i will not touch this money for 15 years
 25 cash i like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare this way if a black swan event happens i not only have money to invest i have money to live on should things go bad for a while this philosophy enabled me to buy options when covid hit in 2020 without worrying if i could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job its also very useful if i have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions i took this from buffet fwiw
 30 options mostly in tax advantaged accounts iras i aim for a 50 annual return overall with this portfolio though it fluctuates a lot year to year
 10 long term blue chips stocks like visa apple msft etc i defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them andor buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur that can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls 
 6 longterm bets in a roth ira these are equities i think all have a chance at a 10x return but that will take 510 years its a lot of ipos small tech companies and biotechs i have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 4050 on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it this is a new strategy for me so ill let you know in 10 years if it works
 3 leveraged hedgesthese are puts on my own positions stocks or the market at large generally i use vix calls buy puts occasionally buy calls on the spxs and run strangles on investments betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts  
 1 in other things i cant mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe

use technologies to find ideas

unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are ok getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends you need to use tools to help you locate investmenttrade ideas and be willing to pay for them i value my time and am willing to pay 5 of my portfolio a year if it saves me time and more if it generates higher returns 

ive tried about a dozen or so services including stock picking services like fool and investorsplace ultimately i decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because i did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps so i switched to analytics tools and my fidelity platform 

my favorite tools to use are zacks vgm score levelfields and fidelity the zacks vgm measures a stocks value growth rate and momentum its an easy screen i can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at the caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99 of the way they are going to move so you need to keep an eye on whats new to the list to avoid losing money that part is crucial 

the list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 69 months warning they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit i use fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price

a friend recently turned me on to an ai tool called levelfields they have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically it helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to midcap companies you dont usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites they often send alerts on company events before theres any news out which is really helpful the interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen so its easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success   
i use it a lot for pinpointing entryexit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies i hadnt ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings not sure why but they never came up in any of my fidelity stock screens i suspect its because theres a lag in the data fidelity is getting from sp but havent confirmed this they send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that theyd have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so i didnt have to look up the stocks on fidelity

i use fidelity for basic news reading running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations looking deeply at the history of earnings results actually trading options and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity  i sell puts when i see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a midpoint in its 52week price range in case it shoots up and then down i always set an automated exit

fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options i use when selling puts it tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range i use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk i do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like gme and tsla my typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which i use to fund new call positions

be wary of analyst opinions

if youve invested actively for a while youve likely noticed a peculiar trend as a stock is cratering analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it this is not for your benefit brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts so there is inherent bias in the system 

ive also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings they are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks one study found less than 1 issued sell recommendations whats more the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping cnbc has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms eg goldman sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right 

i am embarrassed to say i lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality its easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect which is tradable but it boils down to needing to do your own research

good things come in pairs

just about every stock has a peer or competitor most have several i stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders ive owned visa and mastercard i own olo and tost i have a handful of um herbal medicine providers i like etsy and amzn if you bet on a small group of competitors its likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially 

similarly it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy what do i mean if mastercard reports low cross border transactions its highly probable visa will be experiencing the same thing so you can use the information from mastercard to alter your position on visa

exercise financial discipline

even when ive been successful picking investments ive run into problems with how to handle my successes weve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go thats usually the moment ive learned i should be taking some gains a few rules i try hard to follow but still screw up

1 take profits often   
when an option or stock hits 100 return i look to take some profit it may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call but it is just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return you can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up this ensures you cannot lose money my rationale here is simple at a 100 gain i now have more to lose than i have to gain you will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150 then down to 50 on the same positions which makes me want to break things  
if you find yourself up huge on an equity investment switch to options i did this for my baba position and it saved me when it hit 300 i was up 200 i sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares i had about 60k in stock and switched to something like 6k in options when baba crashed down to 150 i really didnt care much i was only down 45k instead of 30k i had my profit of 40k locked in so being down 45k was no big deal  

2 fail fast   
if the option price sinks to 50 in value its likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to praying is not a strategy the other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as i wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date if theres negative news driving this im out i want to fail quickly that allows me time to take the remaining 50 and generate gains with it on a better investment i think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as i tend to be an optimist  

3 profit both ways   
if a stock i hold hits an alltime high in price or valuation i look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts this enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave i hold visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings i sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts this offset a paper loss for me of 20k yesterday alone by 75k in gains which i secured as real profits assuming visa will recover that 7k adds 9 to this years returns for visa  

4 be patient but not greedy   
i have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea especially if using good tools asset managers wealth managers and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months not daily so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness example i held upstart from april to august this year and sold it because it was running flat a couple weeks later the stock tripled fml were the only words i could think of at the time the second thought i had was that i shouldve bought just one call option to replace the stock i sold  
on the flip side once a stock does move a lot higher dont be greedy what goes up fast can come down just as fast i feel a lot worse watching a stockoption go up 200 then come down all the way or more than i do exiting with a 100 gain watching the stock go up more dont chase the perfect trade its a white whale just make money  

5 everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth   
this is as true in boxing thanks mike as it is investing thats why its essential to have a plan a and a plan b should plan a not work out as you thought waiting through it can work but it isnt a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment

dont be fooled this is the market crash my dd,7751,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ipp3e9/dont_be_fooled_this_is_the_market_crash_my_dd/,"ive been researching this a lot lately because i didnt want to get caught in it looking at trends and past data i believe strongly that were in the middle of the market crash i used my knowledge and was able to fully exit my entire 500k portfolio on tuesday maintaining all my gains ive even taken a sizeable position in spy puts 50k worth of dec 260 i got my close friends out well the ones who listened on friday at the first sign of positive movement

first of all a little history lesson on the minksy bubble its basically a theory for how market bubbles happen it occurs in 5 steps i will outline what they are in basic and how the current market looks in relation

1 displacement this is the beginning of a new paradigm where the market changes in a big way for this that was the coronavirus this took place between february to april
2 boom increase in spending begins and major gains start to be made media attention and market involvement begin to increase currently weve seen a huge increase in retail traders who are extremely volatile and massive media attention toward the stock market as it relates to corona news as well as stimulus and recovery speed gains this took place between april and july
3 euphoria people stop caring about any sort of reasonable investment strategy and just start throwing money at stuff tesla is a fantastic example of this but many other stocks in the tech sector are guilty of this july was the beginning of this phase as tesla saw insane growth within a few week period and other companies followed suit very quickly this continued into late august with apple and tesla going to stupid prices after their splits and all the other big tech names reaching wild valuations
4 profit taking smart money starts withdrawing funds from the market as they prepare for the crash we are seeing record insider selling but most publicly it began with tesla announcing they would sell 5bn in new shares their second biggest shareholder then announced they were conveniently rebalancing their portfolio to sell many tesla shares as well this was nothing more than a ploy to pull money out without crashing the market even though it did anyway i will get more in depth on this phase later the biggest catalyst was softbank though and that leads me to the final stage
5 panic selling this is when people start to exit en masse in order to recoup whatever they can we are currently witnessing this the last few days have been a trainwreck on the market wiping out augusts gains entirely

now i know you want to say well look at today were up 2 in the sp this is par for the course on a crash with the corona crash these were the rough day to day movement patterns im using corona as an example for its shortnesssimplicity but all crashes have similar patterns

 1 small loss day 
 2 big loss days 
 3 medium loss days 
 5 gain days there were 5 days of gains in the middle of the march crash 
 1 giant loss day 
 3 sideways days 
 8 slightly down days leading to the bottom 

of those gain days the first was a slowdown but the second was a change of 48 in spspy from an open of 294 to a close of 309 consecutive positive days occurred during every major crash we can see that being mirrored today and will likely see more upward mobility before more big money starts exiting dont be fooled by positive days that does not indicate the crash is over novices tend to think crashes are a short event and that they should hold through them because they missed the boat crashes take weeks minimum but usually months if not years to become fully realized covids crash is the fastest weve had at one month

another trend ive noticed is that these market bubbles are happening and recovering faster and faster the late 80s japanese market crash took 6 years to play out the 2000 dotcom bubble was 4 years the chinese 2007 bubble took 2 years the 2008 oil bubble took 1 year on the flipside the 2007 housing bubble took 5 years the 2008 energy bubble took 3 years were about 6 months into this current bubble but more if you account for any forming bubble from before covid maybe this means nothing but i thought it was worth mentioning

bubble analysts always say there is a warning sign prior to a true collapse ive been seeing these called violent shakeoffs most crashes get one but some get two we had one with the june minicrash one could argue that this current crash could be a violent shakeoff ill get to the alternate scenario later assuming its not which i dont think it is we move to the final trigger the catalyst

catalysts these are are things required to trigger a bubble collapse almost every bubble has had some notable catalysts to trigger the rapid decline as mentioned in profit taking weve had three catalysts occur so far that triggered panic selling new tesla shares secondary tesla offloading and softbank they are the big one and who i will focus on for a minute

to those who dont know softbank bought 4 billion in options during the early days of the market postcovid these options are worth a fortune right now 30bn estimated but they have to be sold in order to be fully capitalized on what everyone is afraid of is softbank doing just that or worse for shareholders holding through a market crash and losing it all in the movie margin call great movie a hedge fund got wind of the housing market crash before everyone else and ultimately sold everything they had in order to get ahead of it single handedly beginning the inevitable market crash to be fair this is a fictional movie and they had a portfolio of like a trillion but its really just mentioned to illustrate my point softbank has to exercise these options which have strike prices likely way below market value if they sell those shares they could easily double their investment even through a crash the problem is that people got so spooked by this revelation that softbank lost over 15 billion in market cap currently at 112bn had this not happened the speed at which we decline wouldve been much slower they have to make those losses up now you know what would do that exercising all their options and selling them for market gains

they cant keep those options forever either at best they have 2 years softbank will try very hard to sell all those off without crashing the market but if it keeps dipping they will become more desperate and start selling them more frantically promoting a panic selling cycle and what are we in a panic selling cycle

if this cycle continues with softbank more will tack on and well see this bubble continue to collapse if it can hold a recovery this week it might survive but of course i dont think it will the end of day today really showed that people are afraid and that given any opportunity selloff will occur i think this is the crash but i could be wrong that brings me to the second and third catalysts

commercial real estate crash the eviction crisis is a real threat to our economy its brushed under the rug pretty heavily pointing to the home real estate market and its gains but the damage is done most major commercial real estate buildings especially apartments are in disarray go look around and see the kinds of deals your local apartments are offering where i am im seeing up to 2 months of free rent in some places ive never seen that before everyone is desperate for paying tenants most commercial properties can weather a bit of this kind of thing but we havent seen anything like this small businesses are shutting down new businesses are not opening no one is shopping who replaces those lost tenants all these properties are heavily in debt thats how the industry works for the most part entrepreneurs and builders finance all projects because they are seen as very safe and its a rule of thumb to never use your own money for investment the margins had become abysmal before corona i once looked into buying commercial real estate and found that i would only cover the expenses and have to solely rely on the property value increasing to make anything worthwhile this will cause properties to bleed out extremely fast there is a commercial real estate collapse coming likely within 6 months and it will compound any damage the tech bubble has done dont forget that this isnt strictly a us problem this is a worldwide problem

vacation industry crash many countries around the world rely on a steady influx of visitors in order to keep their businesses afloat this in turn boosts gdp malaysia for instance is a place i personally visited during covid and it was a desolate wasteland most shops had employees literally standing outside waiting for a single customer it was like this for blocks and blocks huge tourist attractions were completely devoid of people its only a matter of time before our lack of flying catches up to these already poor and extremely hard to maintain businesses the country in malaysia i visited had a notoriously low success rate for new restaurants during the best of times now they are lucky to get any customers that affect will bleed into the second catalyst more businesses going under causing commercial real estate to lose tenants with no one to replace them causing those buildings to go under causing banks to be stuck with a boat load of vacant unprofitable properties causing them to go under

even with a vaccine we wont go back to normal fast enough to recover the losses the airline industry is reporting that they dont estimate returns to normal until late 2021 early 2022 do you think a random joe has enough liquidity to keep his business running that long at extreme drought the people at the bottom of the chain consumers and small business owners were never prepared to have a cash supply on hand for this kind of hit to their lives that is going to trickle up to the top and when it does goodbye market

of course theres also the us election but that will be a small catalyst as far as im concerned



other notable indicatorsinsights that things dont look good

1 market cap to gdp was 21 at peak the dotcom crash was 14 and the recession was 11 currently 1771
2 google trend results for market crash are trending up last week which only accounted for 3 days really already topped the june minicrash
3 an analyst who witnessed the japanese crash of the 1980s believes this will be the biggest crash weve ever seen
4 evs are the new dotcom company many will fail as car creation proves to be more difficult than anticipated
5 high growth high revenue companies do not automatically equate to sustainable companies despite stock prices pretending they do for example sea ltd doubled revenue but also doubled expenses in q2 2020 etoys is a prime example of this from the dotcom bust era had huge revenue but their expenses could not be lowered to a sustainable level and went out of business despite the business model making sense and the revenue stream looking really good
6 the pe ratio of the market is above 30 which has historically always resulted in a market crash
7 apple saw 12 million shares exited at the bell today prior to that was around 600k peak this happened for most tech stocks
8 if you bought microsoft at peak dotcom bust you would have to wait 10 years to breakeven longer if you account for inflation losses that kind of stagnation is what were looking at even today



this does not mean the entire market will crash quite the contrary yes most stocks will go down as the market collapses in overvalued sectors tech brings down the whole thing but they will stay high if priced fairly most epicenter is priced within a reasonable area for instance and will weather the storm quite well at least until the commercial real estate market collapse catches up to them

plan accordingly set stop losses and do your own research i dont expect you to just follow my information blindly i may have gotten things wrong or mixed some wires you need to figure this out on your own and make your own judgement call i simply hope to raise awareness for what i believe is a market crash so that people dont lose their shirt during this i hope im wrong though im literally betting with my money that im not

its completely unrealistic to expect deflation in anything except gas energy and maybe maybe home prices but the way people are talking they expect prices to go to 2020 levels again they wont ever

gme short squeeze what comes next part 5

has the squeeze been sqoze absolutely not

will the squeeze be sqoze potentially 

strap in this is going to be exhaustively long but i have a lot to say

please see my other work im not here to convince anyone of anything i am not a shill i am not here for confirmation bias i am a pragmatic neutral party anyone who calls me a shill in the comments certainly cannot read and did not do their proper dd on me if you read my previous works dating back 3 months ago you will see how terrifyingly accurate i have been thus far even in part 5 i nearly perfectly predicted all of fridays entire movements 

note that does not mean i will remain accurate for the entire duration of this saga i also am not saying all of this to flex its because i am tired of being called a shill when i was the original predictors of this squeeze and have since provided logical thought that has been proven accurate this doesnt mean you should take what i am saying as truth but it does mean that if it doesnt align with your thoughts you should probably put down the koolaid loosen up the tinfoil hat and listen to someone elses opinion so you can make the best decisions for yourself

i am not a financial advisor in fact this isnt even advice it is simply my analysis of the situation as it has always been one thing you will find different with my work than others is my research is changing as the landscape changes if people are still screaming about the original tactic and not acknowledging the new landscape we are in please be very cautious of making financial decisions based on what these people have to say 

i also want to make it crystal clear that i think the squeeze has not been sqoze however the landscape is very different now

finally any pts including support and resistance are beyond difficult to predict please do not take these as certain numbers its the guess right now and that very well could change as soon as the market opens monday

 so what happened friday

for the sake of this not being an entire novel i encourage you to read part 5 as i think that prediction is precisely what happened to summarize we saw a bulltrap open us up in the morning and we ran to  the 135 resistant point volume wasnt enough and we tested in twice before people realized we would not be able to break through thats when selling and more shorting occurred the price dipped down to around 88 now i didnt mention this in the dd but i did mention it in the comments section that i expect interesting price action around 2pm why because of the call options expiring itm 

i think these shares were already covered i know we expect a higher price increase but why where is the math to back that the price should go higher during these covering sessions 

total options that expired on 0226 itm 22713 data from here

this would equate to 2271300 shares 

at 1302 the price fell to 86 this was the bottom before the upswing at the end of the day by 1307 there was a volume of over 20000000 in the buying direction 

not 5 minutes after we found the bottom for the day there was nearly 9x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be covered 

at 1307 alone there was a positive net change in volume of 17656000 nearly 8x the amount of volume required for every single one of these options to be coveredwithin 1 minute 

the rest of the day continued to uptrend where we saw the price rise back to 121 then it began falling off again as did volume 

now ask yourselfwhy would this be the case because none of the price increase at the end of the day was organic purchasing this was the itm calls being covered 

at this point im sure youre ready to stop reading and call me a shill but i encourage you to carry on so we may understand what comes next this may not fit your narrative and thats ok a squeeze is possible it might just be time to think that it wont be happening quite the way you imagined

 before we move on to what comes next lets play with a few more numbers and talk about this idea of holding 

for some reason people still believe that holding your shares is preventing hfs from covering i cannot express how untrue this sentiment is holding is a valid play but it absolutely should not be an attempt from keeping your shares from being bought by shorts a 5 second look at any chart could show you there is more than enough sell volume for shorts to get their shares elsewhere if you are not willing to part with them

lets take the largest post on rgme as an example

the top post of all time received 59600 upvotes according to the comments most people are actually holding only about 110 shares each but for the sake of the argument lets get ridiculous and say every one of those upvotes has someone who owns 100 shares of gme lets also assume every single one of these shares have been restricted from being borrowed to really screw these guys

thats a total of 5960000 shares that are being tucked away so hfs cant get their grubby little paws on them on friday alone 91960000 shares were exchanged so even in the most ridiculous of circumstances there were plenty of other sellers for shorts to purchase their shares back from 

holding is certainly a valid play but there are two things holding certainly does not do

1 it does not increase the price of a stock
2 it does not prevent hfs from covering

if you are holding solely because of these two reasons then you are playing this wrong there are three reasons to actually hold

1 you absolutely do not want to sell at a loss and you believe the short squeeze is imminent so you are patiently waiting for it to occur
2 you are already positioned extremely well like dfv who has a cost basis of 267896
3 you are long on the company and the squeeze is just icing on the cake you can shut off your computer for a year with no concern and come back to know that you are profitable 

if you dont believe me then please examine the evidence

when you purchase a stock the price goes up when you sell a stock the price goes down so what happened when rh restricted trading the price plummeted why because holding and selling were the only options

lets play another absurd game and pretend that 100 of shareholders held when trading was restricted the price would have gone completely sideways it would not have gone up or down

but lets be realistic that will never happen even if retail traders decided to hold institutions certainly are not running around screaming that they are diamond handed apes who would rather go bankrupt before giving their shares up no no they are going to take their profits and they will do so at your expense you call them allies which they are not they are here for profits as we all are and they will gladly sell with 100 gains while everyone else is waiting for 10000 gains

i want to pause for a moment in this dd and take a moment to point something out even though im not trying to convince anyone to sell i have been called all sorts of names as though im evil for offering my opinion and analysis of the situation but lets be absolutely clear you are the ones peer pressuring people into holding you are the ones trying to convince people of your narrative you are the ones who will be responsible when someone takes their life if this does not go the way you hope 

if you have made it this far congratulations i would love to have a discussion regarding the hold play and how people could argue this is a viable tactic for any of the reasons not outlined above 

 my thesis

my thesis remains the same the shorts want a short squeeze yes this sounds absolutely absurd but they are already making a fortune off of this they need to as most of them lost a lot of money on the first round they are reporting their losses publiclybut they have not disclosed their gains 

i think they are intentionally opening unfavorable short positions in order to trigger a squeeze they open and immediately begin to cover creating the much needed buying pressure that triggers fomo and market purchasing as well this allows the price to soar and they absolutely do not intervene 

once it reaches a massive sell wall or what they think is the peak they begin shorting on the way down opening new extremely favorable positions the gains from these new positions offset their losses from the unfavorable onesby a lot 

institutional traders are not stupid they see this is happening and also capitalize on it adding to the buying pressure at the beginning of a squeeze they ride it up and they are part of the massive sell walls as i mentioned before they are more than happy with their 100 gains in a day and have no intent on diamond handing this into the earth 

so institutions ride it up sell at the top where shorts begin opening new positions on the way back down they then short just enough positions at the bottom so that this could be triggered yet again rinse and repeat

i think the idea of the interstellar yoyo was very close to being accurate except it was missing one key component snidely in the story is intentionally doing this 

a circumstance like gme will never happen again when this is all over there will be new regulations in place that dont allow these kinds of things to happen institutions and hfs would be out of their mind to not profit on this for as long as they can

so my thesis is suggesting that there will not be one massive short squeeze but instead a series of squeezes before this thing finally runs out of gas or is regulated into the ground 

lets think about that for a moment

if your original pt on gme was 1000 you are already almost there

the first squeeze took the price from 12 to 500 488 increase

the second squeeze took the price from 40 to 200 160 increase

so already gme has increased around 648 you are now only a 352 increase away from your 1000 pt

is a massive short squeeze still possible

yes however so much of the dd floating around is all talking about possibility but we as investors dont care about that we care about probability 

so what is the probability of a massive short squeeze well there would need to be a significant catalyst like we had on the first go around such as cohen joining the board i think there are still several catalysts which i outline in gme short squeeze what comes next part 3 there could very well be new catalysts that i have not mentioned since that post such as cohen getting appointed ceo as i have learned many believe based on his tweet 

lets talk numbers

there are two very important numbers that need to be broken for a massive squeeze to be possible 

170  this is the upper limit of the downward channel and if this is broken not only does it indicate a trend reversal and potential massive bounce but there is little to no resistance to take us to the next important number

200  this is a massive sell wall why well i think this is where a significant amount of shorts are positioned probably not right at 200 they probably shorted 205 but absolutely do not want anyone to break through that wall

if this sell wall falls it could prove to be an incredibly massive squeeze however it would need to rise a decent amount beyond the 200 wall and maintain that price point to force shorts under for a long enough time period 

if this happens it will begin a domino effect of the well positioned shorts chasing them all the way up to the shorts who entered over 400 at this point fomo  shorts covering could certainly drive the price well over 1000

but what is the probability that this will happen

without a catalyst or an enormous amount of volume

lets consider the first squeeze and volume for reference

jan 22nd this was the highest volume at 197157900 the high was 7676 and the low was 4232

absolutely insane volume but it didnt move the price all that much i mean at least in comparison to other days

jan 25th volume 177874000 h15918 l 6113

jan 26th volume 178588000 h15000 l 8020

jan 27th volume 93396700 h 38000 l 24900

jan 28th volume 58815800 h 48300 l 11225

jan 29th volume 50259200 h 41398 l 25000  


see the pattern

25th 177m volume to nearly triple the price 160

26th even more volume to only double the price 87

27th  half the volume for a 52 increase 

the volume decrease is directly proportionate the the price increasingdecreasing with the exception of beyond the 28th as trading was restricted these first two days were crucial to triggering the squeeze 

the 28th and beyond trading was restricted but if everyone could only sell or hold why wouldnt the price immediately fall how could there still be support this was shorts covering between just those two days there was 109000000 shares exchanged where nearly everyone could only sell a perfect time for shorts to cover 

but i thought when shorts cover the price is suppose to go up 

absolutelyif trading wasnt restricted because virtually everyone could only sell this means that almost all of the shares that were exchanged during these days was purchased by shorts and sold by panic sellers escaping the trading restriction fud 

so as strange as it seems i think the price going up was some shorts covering but for the most part i think they covered while the price was falling i know this seems counterintuitive but regardless of the amount of shares that needed to be covered the amount of selling was able to drive the price down while they covered again think about how there possibly could have been any sort of support while trading was restricted someone was buying massive amounts of shares as the price felland it wasnt us

so hooman if you think they covered already then why do you think a squeeze is still possible

because of my thesis entirely new shorts opened entirely new positions perhaps some of the old hfs also did to try to recoup some losses last week we almost forced this to happen all over again but a ton of new shorts opened positions and the sell wall at 200 prevented us from tipping that very important very first domino this isnt the same landscape we were in where shorts were poorly positioned at very low numbers and we were able to catch them with their pants down this is a different situation entirely 

that situation is still squeezable the question ishow

volume volume volume   
sheer and pure buying power

we would need those first two very important days to happen again and push us past that 200 sell wall and hold us there in order to force the well positioned shorts to close we were so damn close but couldnt quite break it this is precisely why my predictions for friday were so accurate

a catalyst a whale large global sentiment again fomo there are a lot of different ways this is possible but as i mentioned before we as investors deal with probable

in one of my original posts long before this became a meme stonk i literally used the word imminent  in the title thats how sure i was that the data and catalysts were aligned to create this perfect storm if you now notice all of my titles are what comes next that is because this is the honest truth literally no one knows why because third part intervention is now required for this to be possible and global sentiment and fomo has worn off more than that a lot of people have been burned and all the people who are still willing to play this stock are already bagholding and no longer have the capital to help with momentum 

this has gone from a sure thing to a straight up gamble 

if i had to give it a probability which i really dont want to do i would have to say 5050 there is nothing significant pointing to anything that could get us past 200 but it is still possible with catalysts and other factors 

what appears more likely is that this will be a series of squeezes up until it is regulated to death people get bored or a catalyst pops the moasss

but you can be certain of one thing this will end

it does not have to end with a moass but it might my guess is that if there is no significant catalyst that ignites the moass by april then this will be on pause the interesting thing is that the possibility of a moass might never go away but as time passes the probability lessens 

the reason for my april guess is that is the end of all of my upcoming catalysts that could act as triggers it is very possible that this thing cools down after that shorts enter unfavorable positions and then cohen makes huge changes that starts this thing all over again a few months later

that being said i think the most probable outcome is a series of squeezes that quite frankly we are just along the ride for there is no where near enough retail buying power anymore to force anything to happen we are at the whim of institutions and big players who are deciding what comes next how are they getting away with this you so long as the world things that redditors are the reason this is happening they can continue playing

 ive been asked by many of you to examine the dd posted by uheyitspixel 

the dd can be found here

disclaimer both myself and this author are completely guessing as is everyone else you should be reading everyones take and drawing your own conclusions

overall impression well done dd there was a lot of work and effort put into this and the assumptions were data driven i will say there is a hint of biased mentality here using the data to fit the authors narrative from a more objective point of view this simply could have been shorts shorting from a less objective point of view it could fit support my thesis of shorts wanting these microsqueezes lett go as chronologically as possible

on february 23rd gme opened at 4497 within the first few seconds gme reached its day high of 4623 gme also reached its day low at 950am so within 20 minutes after the market opened gme reached its high and its low for the whole day

conclusion someone got the price down by 10  within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that making it seem that their solely goal was to get gme on the ssr for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low and that is really important now

my take i actually find this quite compelling either this was an institution attempting to bait out shorts while preventing a panic sell or it fits my theory that this was actually a short who wanted a short squeeze both ideas are equally nuts but we live in crazy times

tldr hedgies vs unknown institutions ui ui set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above 50 hf know and dont want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of gme to keep it below 50 both sides waiting for the other one to do something battle will start shortly before the market closes just a theory no advice ape hoping for banana 

my take i agree large institutions are in this and want a squeeze as much as we do either that or a whale buyer like chamath i also agree with the 50 assumption as that was a clear battle ground where we disagree is i think that last week was in fact the gamma squeeze however we did not have enough volume to continue off of the gamma squeeze and tip the next more important domino at 200

on february 25th there was a short volume of at least 33000000 to 51000000 shares highest report 

my take well first of all i really wish there was a link to this data but lets go with fintels data that shows 33 million short volume on 0225 if you look at the chart for 0225 there are two very clear moments where this volume occurred my guess would be these shorts are positioned between 140180 this is one of the reasons i have been saying that the 135 resistance is a key point if this domino can be tipped it will drive us up to the 170 and 200 point but will we have the volume to break through those gates when we get there im not sure i mean i hope so but im not sure

anything about naked shorting or what the actual short interest is or where the shorts are actually hiding im not even going to touch why because it doesnt matter

this goes back to my original point everyone is running around trying to answer the wrong question and prove that the squeeze has not been squozen but who cares i think 5 minutes of research can show you there is still an immense amount of short interest in this stock what we need to be asking is will the squeeze be squozen and if so how

march 19th including the options chain xrt data ftds etc i think this date could in fact act as a catalyst but thats about it to me i would just add this to my list of potential catalysts and not think much of it there is a lot of good information backing this theory but there is a whole lot more theory backing this theory in my opinion this date should just be added to list of potential catalysts that could either a spark the moass or b it could be the date of another microsqueeze

my conclusion the squeeze is inevitable

my take absolutely not inevitable certainly possible

 monday predictions

again this is not including any unforeseen catalysts that could kick this thing off i cant express that enough that is why holding is gamble that could really go either way if something happens whether we see it or not it could send this thing skyrocketing my predictions for monday are based on no new catalysts

virtually i am expecting a repeat of friday that could end differently

open i am expecting a sharp price increase at open volume again will a key indicator as to which direction this is going to go 

i imagine we will struggle at 115 resistance but we can hopefully blow through that the real test will come at 135 resistance

 if we reach 135 and blow through it then this gets very interesting i see the next resistance points at 150 155 and then the really important ones of 170 and 200 i already explained that if we surpass these limits we are setting up nicely for a moass

if we reach 135 but volume is too low if youre not sure how to gauge the volume keep an eye on how many times we retest it if it takes more than two attempts without a significant volume boost i cant imagine us being able to handle the more difficult resistance points

shortly after open my guess right now is still before 1000 but it could go later in the day if im wrong about people covering on friday if we have not broken through those early resistance points i think the slow bleed will begin 

my bottom pt is somewhere between 6080

once we hit this mark it gets difficult to predict no one understands at all how the market fairly values this stock the closest i would say would be 4050 since thats where the greatest support we had was it is entirely possible we see a bounce from the 6080 price if shorts use this opportunity to cover the market sees it as a good point to enter and ride the wave or if gme is now simply valued at this price due to the management changes that helped kickstart this second wave to begin with

after that its a blur this truly is a day to day stock to analyze and sadly i cannot provide this kind of dd every single day i dont have work monday so im considering live streaming this

 so whats your play hooman

now some of you will call me a shillorwhatever but i simply have a different tactic you might believe in the moass but im not certain i think its probable so i will be playing these mircosqueezes instead 

i mentioned in my last post i have a really nasty wash sale from what i understand this is simply for tax purposes but my cost basis is still being increased by 100 ie if i purchase the stock for 80 my cost basis will be adjusted to 180 im still unclear on how this works if someone could clarify in the comments section i would absolutely love to continue playing this stock i will be spending the rest of today attempting to find this answer on my own time as well so if im not responsive to the comments like i usually am please understand i am attempting to prepare for this week

soas long as the wash sale isnt an actual reflection of my real price then i will buy as soon as the market opens i will wait until we see how we handle resistance and if it looks like we have a shot at winning i will buy more there to fight the good fight if it looks like there is nowhere near enough volume and my purchase wont make a difference then that will be my indicator to sell 

this part is vital if you are selling at the resistance points you are hurting the cause buying at these points is what will break through the wall but if we make multiple attempts and cannot break through and it starts falling then you might as well profit you holding wont change the fact that we couldnt break resistance i cant stress this enough if you simply sell when we hit resistance you will be part of the reason the squeeze doesnt happen so either holding or buying will help push the price up at these targets but if it is lost no matter what you do then sell and prepare for another attempt

once it gets below 90 i will start scooping up shares again averaging down with the price i do this instead of going all in trying to predict the bottom

from there i will wait to see if that second bounce does in fact happen again if it does i will sell at whatever i think the top is and then will reenter just before close again if there is enough volume and it appears there is a chance to break through then i will not sell i will buy to try to push through that resistance

why would i reenter just before close three reasons

1 im better positioned and back on board in case the moass does trigger
2 i wont have to buy at open if we see the same exact pattern on tuesday
3 i am bullish on gme thanks to cohen and would like to reopen my long position

if the same pattern continues tuesday i will repeat this play until the pattern stops and i am sitting on a lot more shares at a much better cost basis

tldr the squeeze has not been squoze but it has become closer to 5050 odds that it will occur i think its more probable that a series of microsqueezes occur and i will play accordingly simply holding does not increase a price buying does my play will not only net me profits but it will increase my buying power significantly there is no tldr to justify this post if you dont feel like reading then you arent playing with enough money to be concerned and none of this applies to you anyways just remember this will all come to an end at some point and that end is not guaranteed with a squeeze happy trading

disclaimer i am not a financial advisor none of this is advice at all it is my analysis of the situation that i have been following and my interpretation of the data at hand the only direct advice i have for anyone is you should do whats best for you i am bullish on gme long term which makes this a lot less risky for me because if i end up with bags as long as they arent too heavy thats perfectly fine with me anyone who tries to convince you i am a shill or bot is almost certainly an uneducated investor i am not even a bear on this situation but you should always examine the bear case not blatantly ignore it in search of confirmation bias",0.0,0.09124319958061794

why you shouldnt use robinhood,7427,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7id8j/why_you_shouldnt_use_robinhood/,"ive seen a ton of posts from newer investors on what brokerages to use and i want to be clear on why you shouldnt use rh

who is their customer and what is their product

rh would say the customer is you the retail investor but dont customers give money for services  oh right they make money from order flow that means their real customer is citadel

what does that make retail investors  the product  just like fb and others you are essentially the product that is being pawned around except in this case you have your own dollars at stake

is this necessarily bad  depends  but if you are not their customer you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor  the sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients

also its a tech company not a financial services company  not inherently a bad thing but a company whos core competency is software development and not equities trading id think twice

ira  sorry  i havent looked into why specifically but it likely doesnt generate the same money as a brokerage account  if you were actually rhs customer why wouldnt they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country

customer service  never used it but again its a tech company when have you ever got on the phone with google

a tip that i heard right when i started trading that has helped keep me sane and grow as an investor,7357,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhd8gm/a_tip_that_i_heard_right_when_i_started_trading/,"ive only been trading with real money for about a month but i read something a few months ago while doing my research that really stuck and i wanted to share

as investors we often look at the moves weve made and judge ourselves on what we missed on or what we hit on this is part of growing and learning as an investor

but the thing that many people forget is the almost trades those trades that we got close to pulling the trigger on but didnt whatever that reason was we all have moves that we almost made but something made us pass on it 

write them down

record every trade that you almost made or considered making record the date the current value and the reason you didnt make the trade

this has been very valuable to me in my first few weeks of trading we all look through our portfolio and our trade history and think man  if only i held this longer or i really messed up buying this on the rise but what we often forget is to give ourselves credit the the decisions we made that there isnt a history of on our chosen broker for every single regret we have as traders there is a dodged bullet that our gut training or education helped us avoid on the flip side there are also those securities we saw a post about or noticed while browsing that sparked something in us but we hesitated on those ones that have been nothing but green since then and we are regretting

if you dont record the moves you almost made then youre missing out on valuable person growth information that can help you become a better trader write down every move you almost made in a notebook and look back every once in a while the more you write at the time the better

hope this can help others as much as its helped me good luck yall

costco has no plans to change the price of its 150 hot dogandsoda combo despite record high inflation membership fee to remain flat,7162,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xn1ibc/costco_has_no_plans_to_change_the_price_of_its/,"a top costco wholesale executive confirmed the bigbox retailer has no plans to change the price of its 150 hot dogandsoda combo at its stores despite months of decadeshigh inflation

costco cfo richard galanti reiterated the cheap price point on the fanfavorite deal would stay in place during the companys fourthquarter earnings call on thursday

an analyst asked whether costco was adjusting prices in other parts of its business to maintain sales margins for its hot dogandsoda deal and other value offerings

lightning just struck me galanti joked when the combo was mentioned he added that highermargin businesses such as gas and travel sales help costco maintain its value deals

those things help us be more aggressive in other areas or as you mentioned hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer  forever galanti added

costco and other retailers have hiked prices over the last year passing along the higher costs of commodities and goods to consumers inflation has slightly declined in recent months but was still hovering at a hotterthanexpected 83 in august

 galanti estimated that price inflation at costco was about 8 during the fourth quarter with increases a little higher on the food and sundries side

costco doesnt have any immediate plans to hike its membership fees according to the executive annual membership dues at the retailer currently start at 60

 still galanti noted that membership price increases were likely at some point in the future costco has generally hiked its fees roughly every five to six years

our view is is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point we will but its a question of when not if galanti said

despite the inflationary environment costco topped analysts expectations in the fourth quarter the retailer posted quarterly revenue 7209 billion and earnings per share

 a year earlier trump media  technology group reported a net profit of 505 million and total revenue of only 147 million according to the 8k filing

the share price of trump media fell sharply monday morning after the social media app company closely tied to former president donald trump reported a net loss of 582 million on revenue of just 41 million in 2023

trump media  technology group shares were trading down by more than 188 as of 1238 am et

despite that plunge the companys market capitalization was still more than 68 billion after its 8k filing with the securities and exchange commission revealed the loss for last year

much of the net loss appears to come from 394 million in interest expense according to the filing

a spokesperson for the company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the new filing

the filing shows that in 2022 trump media had a net profit of 505 million and total revenue of only 147 million

the company ended 2023 with just 27 million in cash on hand the filing said

the losses last year by trump media  the owner of the truth social app routinely used by the former president  could continue for some time according to the company

tmtg expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future says the filing which came a week after the company began trading under the ticker djt on the nasdaq

the filing also warns shareholders that trumps involvement in the company could put it at greater risk than other social media companies

tmtg also disclosed to regulators that the company had identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting when it prepared a previous financial statement for the first three quarters of 2023

as of monday trump media said these identified material weaknesses continue to exist

trump owns 573 of trump media shares a stake valued at more than 4 billion which forbes last week said would represent well more than half of his total net worth

he also stands to receive another 36 million shares of socalled earnout shares over the next three years as long as trump medias stock during that time hits a series of price benchmarks these targets are all well below the companys stock price early monday

trump medias share price rocketed when its stock began trading tuesday several days after the firm merged with a special purpose acquisition company the newly merged company now trades under trumps initials djt

analysts note that the companys high valuation is partly due to stock purchases by trumps political supporters who are enthusiastic about owning part of a company so closely associated with the presumptive republican presidential nominee

that enthusiasm creates unique risks for the company however the new 8k filing says that trump media may be subject to greater risks than typical social media platforms because of the focus of its offerings and the involvement of president trump

these risks include active discouragement of users harassment of advertisers or content providers increased risk of hacking of tmtgs platform lesser need for truth social if first amendment speech is not suppressed criticism of truth social for its moderation practices and increased stockholder suits",-0.0625,0.06857423440756773

market conditions like these are when millionaires a born not during decade long bull markets,6920,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vdl954/market_conditions_like_these_are_when/,"i dont know what else to say title sums it up pretty well this sub is becoming the epitome of buy high sell low everyone talks about how they wish they bought x or y asset back when it was cheap now things are getting cheap again and instead of staying level headed people are just losing their minds but its funny to me because its people lump sum investing into solid investment during conditions like these that end up walking away as millionaires

its funny also how so many were smug and dismissive about anything that wasnt an overhyped large cap tech stock and now thats those are imploding people have no imagination what else to invest in 

 work hard to maintain an income that affords you enough to invest not easy but this should be your priority

 dca all the way down and then continue dcaing on the eventual return up 

 put most of your money in global market index funds only put a small part of your portfolio towards stocks you do great dd in

if you are young and do these things youll walk away a millionaire

word of advice from someone who was like many of you,6857,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lyfatd/word_of_advice_from_someone_who_was_like_many_of/,"i know its annoying another one of those dont sell its going to be okay posts

i used to check my stock app every minute and sold because i got nervous and uncomfortable i would see gains that have made insane money disappear and sell off trying to hopefully get back at a lower price from personal experience i would encourage many of you to take one hard look at your stock portfolio right now and ask yourself if this is a company you see being able to exist in the longterm future if the answer is no you should cut some of your position or get rid of it if the answer is yes sit back maybe liquidate a few shares but dont get uneasy about it its the stock market  you win some you lose some if the company you own isnt going through a fundamental change such as a huge decrease in revenue or an sec investigation stop being upset

if i never sold a single share of any company from the day i started investing i would likely be a millionaire right now with an initial investment of 30000 dont make the same mistake i did buy companies you trust and can reasonably see being a sustainable business and just ride it more often than not youre going to end up green from what i see now there are going to be a ton of opportunities to get in on some stocks soon you should be putting more attention on what you should buy rather than what you should sell right now",0.5,0.07835884353741496

gasoline prices top 5 a gallon nationally for the first time and are likely headed higher,6815,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v9wqou/gasoline_prices_top_5_a_gallon_nationally_for_the/,"the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline rose above 5 nationally for the first time due to increased demand from the economy reopening from the pandemic and depleted oil supplies stemming in part from the war in ukraine

prices look set to continue rising into the summer months analysts said

the average national price reached 5004 on saturday thats up from about 307 a year ago and a record price not adjusted for inflation at the end of the week prices had already averaged 5 or more in about 20 states with the highest prices on the west coast

by my calculations the typical household is spending about 160 more on gas a month than a year ago said mark zandi chief economist at moodys analytics thats a big bite

gasoline prices normally peak in midmay but this year they have continued to rise and the average price is about 65 cents higher than a month ago due to short supplies this year analysts are forecasting that prices may not top out until midjuly when summer driving season traditionally peaks

i dont think were far away from the highest prices said patrick dehaan head of petroleum analysis at gasbuddy i dont think it would eclipse 550 i would say 525 is the top but again the market is unhinged

however if there are any serious refinery outages this summer or disruptions from hurricanes gasoline prices could spike he added

gasoline is in shorter supply than normal because the us has lost about 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity since before the pandemic at the same time sanctions on russian energy has sent oil prices sharply higher and created tight supplies of both oil and fuel globally

analysts say while consumers are feeling pain at the pump the price of fueling a car with gasoline is not as big a part of a households spending as it had been in the past that is in part due to more efficient vehicles

according to a cnbc analysis drivers were spending an estimated average 20 cents per mile on gasoline as of june this year even with the steep price increases in 1980 that same mile would have cost 30 cents in todays dollars",0.25,0.04988839285714286
biden administration is moving ahead with a ban on russian oil imports,6797,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/t8t9ep/biden_administration_is_moving_ahead_with_a_ban/,"washington march 7 reuters  the biden administration is willing to move ahead with a ban on russian oil imports into the united states without the participation of allies in europe two people familiar with the matter told reuters after russias invasion of ukraine

president joe biden is expected to hold a video conference call with the leaders of france germany and the united kingdom on monday as his administration continues to seek their support for a ban on the imports

the white house is also negotiating with congressional leaders who are working on fasttracking legislation banning russian imports a move that is forcing the administration to work on an expedited timeline a source told reuters

a senior us official told reuters that no final decision has been made but it is likely just the us if it happens

oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 due to delays in the potential return of iranian crude to global markets and as the united states and european allies consider banning russian imports

europe relies on russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning russian products read more the united states relies far less on russian crude and products but a ban would help drive prices up and pinch us consumers already seeing historic prices at the gas pump read more

us house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi said in a sunday letter that her chamber is exploring legislation to ban the import of russian oil and that congress intends to enact this week 10 billion in aid for ukraine in response to moscows military invasion of its neighbor

a bipartisan group of us senators introduced a bill on thursday to ban us imports of russian oil the bill is getting fasttracked

after russia invaded ukraine the white house slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to russias refineries and the nord stream 2 gas pipeline which has never launched

so far it has stopped short of targeting russias oil and gas exports as the biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and us energy prices

asked if the united states has ruled out banning russian oil imports unilaterally us secretary of state anthony blinken on sunday said im not going to rule out taking action one way or another irrespective of what they do but everything weve done the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners blinken said

at the same time the white house did not deny that biden might make a trip to saudi arabia as the united states seeks to get riyadh to increase energy production axios reported that such a trip was a possibility

this is premature speculation and no trip is planned a white house official said

a year ago biden shifted us policy away from a focus on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman who is considered by many to be the de facto leader of saudi arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85yearold king salman

why i fail to see how the metaverse will succeed,6733,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/s62x5o/why_i_fail_to_see_how_the_metaverse_will_succeed/,"ive read that a lot of people here are super bullish on the metaverse and various digital words

as a vr consumer and developer i however am very skeptical that the masses will flock to an digital world

the metaverse is not a new concept its been around since the 90s if not further back there is already a form of metaverse called second life where you can own properties join communities and pretty much live in a real world

x200b

now i know a lot of people will say that we simply dont know the possibilities yet and we are thinking too simple minded but lets be creative what could be some use cases that people would prefer doing digital vs real life

metaverse cinema yeah that already exists in current vr games and its really not that fun and you obviously cant recreate the pixel density nor the actual sound acoustic that a lot of people dont get from their home system

x200b

meetings yeah i guess if you prefer to strap a vr headset on you and be forced to see your digital coworkers instead of having a 2d teams screen where you can actually do something else than stare at your coworkers during the meeting

x200b

dating i almost dont want to go into this are you telling me a digital date would surpass the actual real life vision of a human the smells the toucing hand 

x200b

virtual jog by the beach i literally saw this example on the sub you think people would really want to jog in a virtual beach oppose to actually going outside

x200b

whatever the metaverse is it will be a subpar experience to the real thing unless we can advance graphic rendering by a hella of a lot or actually tapping into our senses i fail to see how the metaverse would awe anyone 

x200b

if we do go fully inception simulation reality then we got bigger issues than the metaverse

with that said i still think it could be future revenue in this field but it wont be as massive as some people here think",-0.5,0.04637841832963785
